This repository includes scripts from May 2021 used to complete an exploratory descriptive analysis of Multiple Listing Service (MLS) data, real property data, and other housing market related data for a set of southeast Baltimore neighborhoods including:

- Baltimore Highlands
- Ellwood Park
- Highlandtown
- Kresson
- Madison/Eastend
- McElderry Park
- Orangeville
- Patterson Park

The MLS data is not publicly available and is not included in this repository. The Zillow data is also not included in the package but is available [through the Zillow Research housing data website](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/). There are other undocumented dependencies in this repository but it is published here for reference and for possible future development to turn these scripts into more general functions for publication in an R package.
